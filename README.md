# Who are the Roosevelt Racers (RR)?

We are a dedicated team of students at Eleanor Roosevelt High School participating in this year's U.S. National F1 in Schools competition. As a rookie team in 2017, we placed 1st in New York, 2nd in the New York Super Regionals, and 9th overall nationwide. All members of the Roosevelt Racers have 200+ hours of experience in their specialized fields. This year, we are the only team from New York. If we win or come in second place nationally, we'll advance to the World Finals.

This is what it looks like IRL:

# What is new about V2?

The first version of the Race Time Calculator used a model developed by the 2017 RND team. It had flaws which the team was aware of but unable to solve because the model would be more complicated and require a lot more computation. Still 2017 won the best RND award in the nationals competeion for their research.
V2 will solve these flaws and create a more accurate model of the Race Time calculator. V2 will also have a sleeker and more polished website than version one. This new version would be a big leap foward for the current RND team because it would provide the Roosevelt Racer's team with a newer and more accurate model while also developing a sleek app; as far as we know, no other team has this type of technology.
